       There once was a <span class="animal">ANIMAL</span> that lived in a cave, and all he wanted to do was <span id ="action">ACTION</span> . However, <span class="name">name</span>'s <br>
        parents wanted him to become a <span id="job">JOB</span>. <span class="name">name</span> was frustrated that his parents wouldn't let him do what he <br>
        wanted to do, so he did what he always did: <span id="action">ACTION</span>. But then the police came, telling <span class="name">Name</span> to stop <br>
        <span id ="action">ACTION</span>ing. Eventually, <span class="name">name</span> was charge for a <span id="number">NUMBER</span> year long sentence and was forever known <br>
        as the crazy <span id ="action">ACTION</span>ing <span class="animal">animal</span>.
